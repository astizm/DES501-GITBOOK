## Activity 1.2

IT is crucial to most businesses operating in our modern world. From small, home-based companies to multi-national conglomerates, each and every one will need to interact with technology on a regular basis. Whether running a website, advertising, doing payroll, communicating with clients or employees, scoping projects etc. There are so many different needs and uses for technology which is a large part of why the industry has boomed and continued to expand over the last twenty years. Implementing, operating and maintaining technologies can be expensive so it is also crucial that the business carries this out in the most cost-effective way and researches the best option for their needs.



## Activity 1.3

DevOps Developer - [https://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs/it/programming-development/listing-2540546054.htm?rsqid=567ac2ab446141b1a7c24806173e142e-003](https://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs/it/programming-development/listing-2540546054.htm?rsqid=567ac2ab446141b1a7c24806173e142e-003) The things that appeal to me about this role is the potential to create as well as problem solving and implementing solutions. Home-based employment is also a perk!



## Activity 1.4

It is crucial for any forward thinking business to maintain a healthy balance of being proactive about future changes, and being flexible after those changes have occurred. If an IT company were to add a new service, a number of factors would have to be considered. Everything from the number of new personnel required, new software, space, salaries, amongst many other factors need to be considered before any action is begun. This will make sure the growth is feasible.

After a plan is agreed upon and the action is started, a multitude of problems and/or different opportunities could present themselves. A decent amount of flexibility is required to recognize and navigate the different conflict and/or opportunities in order to make the right decisions. The size of the business will have a great impact on these aspects as well, the bigger the business the more moving parts will be involved.

A model of this may allow for "moving parts" within the business. Potential hires should realisitically be flexible in their positions within the company and existing hires should also have some knowledge of the other departments within their scope. This can be reflected from an administerial point by the leadership allowing for new departments and roles to be made as needed.



## Activity 1.5

Technology has overarching effects on all aspects of business throughout communication and efficiency in day-to-day tasks. It has expanded our world and has allowed for businesses to quickly grow on a global scale. Obviously the specific of this are dependent on the type of business but some key differences in operations and strategic decisions can be noted.

**Business strategy -** An important part of business strategy is innovation and growth. Technology allows for this to happen at an exponential rate.     

**Organisational culture -** Technology can have a direct impact on the processes which a business implements and the efficiency and understanding of those processes can directly impact the culture of the business, negatively or positively.

**Organisational structure -** Technology can make or break positions within a company. An increase in efficiency can result in fewer or more positions depending on the way the business decides to grow. Leaps in communication technology means that an employee might almost never set foot in an office, completing work from their home or job site. This may result in a less heirarchal structure within a company as decisions are made as needed on the spot but can also result in managers being \(or wanting to be\) consulted at every step.

**Business processes -** The processes that a business operates are overwhelmingly affected by the technology they have available to them, as well as its employees understanding of those processes and technology. More technologically advanced processes can result in more efficient and cost-efficient outcomes and help create growth. 

**The nature of work -** Technology can help create but it can also innovate to the point of roles becoming completely redundant. As new technologies become common and widely used the nature of work and the roles in the workplace shift to complement the new technology available.
