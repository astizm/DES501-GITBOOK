## Activity 2.1

### The Role of Information Management

The role of Information Management is a vital one that encompasses all aspects of an organisations’ incoming and outgoing information. It involves analysis, security, storage, collection, curation, distribution and destruction of data as required. Information is what creates an organisation – without the knowledge needed it cannot function. It is therefore equally vital that this role has a dedicated person and/or team to oversee all the needs for content management, whether those processes are automated by software or collected and analysed manually by staff. 

## Activity 2.2

### Information Management Stockholders

Slingshot is an ISP based in NZ primarily focussed on residential broadband \(Slingshot, 2020\). They are a subsidary of Vocus Group Ltd, an Australian owned telecommunications company that also owns Orcon, Flip and 2Talk \(Vocus Group, 2019\). The owners of Vocus Group Ltd and Slingshot have since sold up or left their positions leaving the current NZ CEO Mark Callender as a primary internal stakeholder for Slingshot, as well as the rest of their executive branch Taryn Hamilton – Chief Executive for Consumer and Business, Steven Kurzeja – CTO, Aaron Smith – CFO, Mark O’Connell – CPO, Emily Acland – Legal \(Vocus Group, 2019\) and other employees \(approximately 300 people in NZ \(Vocus Group Ltd, 2020\)\). Vocus Group is a publicly listed company and anyone with the ability to buy can potentially be a shareholder \(IBISWorld, 2019\).

As of 2018 Vocus Group has 208,000 customers across their NZ brands for broadband, phone, power and mobile \(ShareChat, 2018\). These customers along with their suppliers Chorus, Enable, UltraFastFibre and NorthPower \(Crown Infrastructure Partners, 2018\) make up their main external stakeholders. Unfortunately, there are no current records of customer statistics specific to Slingshot. Government \(local and international\), in particular the Commerce Commission, and the NZ public in general play a part as a stakeholder as well, the actions of the company and vice versa can largely affect each other.
