## Activity 5.1

### Interface Design & Elements

#### **Explain in your own words what interface elements are:**

Interface elements are controls or tools through which the user communicates with, to or recieves information from the interface.

#### **Choose at least 4 of the elements introduced in the article and find and upload screenshot examples of each:**

![Navigational controls such as bread crumbs](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%289%29.png)

![Containers/Accordion style link container](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

![Information components such as tool tips - tips displayed when hovered over.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)

#### Can you also find an example of a where the UI design uses typography to create hierarchy and clarity?

Use of hierarchy to define heading, subheading and body of text. Okay use of line-spacing and white space to aid clarity - text could be larger for a better effect.





## Activity 5.2

### Considerations of Interface Design

#### Think of at least 4 different technologies where user interface design is an important consideration.

* Virtual reality systems
* Infotainment systems
* Personal AI assistants
* Smart phones

#### Why and how the user interface approach for each of these types of devices/technologies needs to differ.

Each of these technologies are emerging ones with newly arising technological advances as well as potential complications every day. The way that people interact with each of them is slightly different as well as what people expect and want from each technology. For two of these systems ensuring that people are interacting with them safely is paramount. In the case of infotainment that means reducing the risk for dangerous distractions that may cause the user to crash their car.  
Each manufacturer of these technologies also wants to ensure that their devices and software are unique to their brand, as well as being identifiable to that brand. Small differences in the details can quickly change that.
