## Activity 4.1

### Challenges of User Experience Design

User experience \(UX\) design takes the ideals and goals of stakeholders and attempts to merge this into a meaningful and enjoyable experience to users.  In my view the biggest challenge of UX design is that the role is enormous. It encompasses aspects of marketing, design, accessibility and more. Because of this it's time consuming, it introduces complexity to a product, where the designers may previously have been able to complete that product much more efficiently without contemplating user experience, and as such increases the timeline and cost of production.   
It also doesn't seem to have a truly determined method of implementation, rather it relies on anecdotal data or surveys which may or may not have any real impact on the end users experience, especially if the questions being asked aren't the right ones.  This becomes even more of an issue if the users that are surveyed and relied upon aren't the right audience or a consistant user base. 

## Activity 4.2

### Usability

1. **Research and discuss how usability and user experience differ from one another.** Usability is just one aspect of user experience. It ensures the functional purpose of the product. That a user can go through the process of whatever the goal of the product is and make it out the other side without getting stuck. Whereas user experience attempts to take that process and make it an enjoyable experience.     
2. **Decide on the things to be considered when assessing the usability of a system?** There are several factors commonly referred to as usability hueristics. Learnability seems to cover many of these aspects but it is broken down further into specific branches such as memorability and efficiency. A few other things to consider would be, how prone to errors is the system and how easily can a user fix an issue or find help to solve that issue? Is there appropriate and visible feedback from the interface? Is it consistent and precise throughout?     
3. **Find at least one example of a system \(e.g. website, mobile app, etc.\) that demostrates good usability and one with poor usability. Take screenshots to aid in explaining your reasoning for coming to these conclusions.** It's far easier to find bad websites than good ones. The example of a good website that I chose feels like it follows most of the rules. The design is easy to look at and simple to follow with clear direction. The pointer changes when you mouse over a clickable button, which is a small thing but unfortunately uncommon. When you go to the quizzes you can scroll through but there isn't an easily visible option which makes it seem as though it's been manipulated so that the user preferably starts at the beginning, but doesn't have to, allowing some flexibility for the user. My biggest complaint would be that the header bar directs to the quizzes and not the home page.    ****

This website is meant to provide helpful articles and tips but it's practically unreadable and is unusable on mobile. It's slow, there's an invisible header and footer that stays while scrolling through, making the readable space barely half of what it should be. The shop doesn't have those issues but the button functions don't always react as expected, the process is clumsy and unlikable.
